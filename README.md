### Hi there 👋
I am Rhys B and I currently work as a Systems/Network Administrator in Australia. I am currently studying for a bachelor’s in computer science part-time. Primarily my contributions have been to the “legacy” Minecraft community, a community centred around 2010-2011 builds of the game. Most of my time has gone towards improving the server side of the multiplayer software to improve multiplayer experiences.
