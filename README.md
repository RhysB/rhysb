### Hi there 👋
I am Rhys B and I currently work as a Systems Administrator in Australia. I am currently studying for a bachelor’s in computer science part-time. Primarily my contributions have been to the “legacy” Minecraft community, a community centred around 2010-2011 builds of the game with most of my time has gone towards improving the server side of the multiplayer software to improve multiplayer experiences.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Project Poseidon and Fundamentals
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and more advanced Active Directory
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on my various projects on my GitHub.
